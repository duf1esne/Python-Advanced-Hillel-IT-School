The 2020 Mazda CX-9 is proof that a fun-to-drive formula used for small cars like the Mazda 3 can also work on a three-row 
SUV. Drivers will be impressed with its handling, smooth ride and fuel economy. In a class of large vehicles, those three 
strengths make the CX-9 a break from the norm.

There are more conventional SUV things to like about it too. The interior, especially in higher trims, is outfitted with 
high-quality materials. The cabin is quiet on the road and seating is comfortable. A controller dial helps you easily 
navigate a sharp infotainment menu. We're less enamored with the cargo space, tight third row and towing capability â€” but 
that's the trade-off for a dynamic vehicle this large.

The Kia Telluride has rugged flair, the Hyundai Palisade screams "upscale," and the Honda Pilot stresses versatility. But 
the Mazda CX-9 is about enjoying the drive. Its styling will turn heads, and the newly standard i-Activsense package 
brings extensive safety features. That's a unique SUV blueprint, and shoppers will do themselves a favor by putting this 
Mazda on their list.
