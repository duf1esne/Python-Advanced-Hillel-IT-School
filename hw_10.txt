Australian magpie in the family Artamidae. It is a large crow-like bird, around 50 cm (20 in) long, with yellow irises,

a heavy bill, and black plumage with white wing patches. The sexes are similar in appearance. Three subspecies are
recognised, one of which, S. f. colei of King Island, is vulnerable to extinction.
The black currawong is generally sedentary, although populations at higher altitudes relocate to lower areas during the
cooler months. The habitat includes densely forested areas as well as alpine heathland. It is rare below altitudes of
200 m (660 ft). Its omnivore diet includes a variety of berries, invertebrates, and small vertebrates. Less arboreal
than the pied currawong, the black currawong spends more time foraging on the ground.
